# resource-with-multiple-responses
Demonstrating multiple responses in the resource API

In Angular version v19.2.0-next.0: https://github.com/angular/angular/releases/tag/19.2.0-next.0

We have a new feature "support streaming resources (#59573)": https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/59573

Example 1: I (Andy Man) combine the resource api with linkedSignals. Here you see how the loader is used in the resource api.

Example 2: I checked the PR and implemented one of the unit tests.

Example 3: I and with the help of Lars, got it working by calling the cat API inside the stream of the resource api.

Example 4: Work in progress. Would be great if had a working example with multiple responses.
